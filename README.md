# Parking Manager

#### This project has been tested and compiled only with Java 8.

## Compile parent project
If you what to use the Java API as a maven dependency please checkout the project is folder "parking" and run :
```shell
mvn install
```
## Install to client using maven

The preferred way to start the project in client side is to add the dependency to your client project.
```xml
<!-- The client -->
<dependency>
	<groupId>fr.walidg.park</groupId>
	<artifactId>parking</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
	<scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```
## Install to client using Java dependency (Alternative)
Without maven, please add to your project all files in "WithoutMaven" folder in client your build path.

## Usage

In the client application we need to create a ParkingLotBuilder to initiate a parking.

```java
		ParkingLotBuilder plb = new ParkingLotBuilder();
		ParkingLotManager plm = plb
				.withElectric20Slots(1)
				.withElectric50Slots(0)
				.withPetrolSlots(10)
				.withPrincing(ParkingLotBuilder::FixedAndTimePricing)
				.build();
```

### Options

#### withElectric20Slots
Number of parking Slots available for Electric 20KW cars
* Type: `Integer`
* Default: `0` 
#### withElectric50Slots
Number of parking Slots available for Electric 50KW cars
* Type: `Integer`
* Default: `0` 
#### withPetrolSlots
Number of parking Slots available for petrol cars
* Type: `Integer`
* Default: `0` 
#### withPrincing
Princing function, can be a static or not function
* Type: `Function<Slot, Float>`
* Default: `s -> 10.5f` 
Build in function can be used as : 
```java
ParkingLotBuilder::TimeOnlyPricing
ParkingLotBuilder::FixedAndTimePricing
```
#### Pricing
Number of parking Slots available for petrol cars
* Type: `Integer`
* Default: `0` 

### Hypothesis
- No cheating user (ex. changing Vehicle plates inside the parking)
- Pricing function is "safe" (thread-safe and no runtime exception)
- No casting issue when converting price (duration of stay must be reasonable), same for number of slots.

### I/O parking
- Create a Vehicle from import fr.walidg.park.parking.ParkingClient.*.
- Request a slot from the parking using plm.getASlot(vehicle).
- Free the slot to exit the parking using plm.freeASlot(vehicle).

```java
Electic20KwVehicule v = new Electic20KwVehicule("ID");
Slot s = plm.getASlot(v);
Float price = plm.freeASlot(v);
System.out.println(String.format("The price is :  %10.2f â‚¬", price));
```

### Pricing
The pricing function takes in argument a Slot instance occupied by the car and returns the expected price. The slot has a member "occupiedSince" that is the DateTime of the entering.

- For static method please have a look to this example

```java
	public static Float FixedAndTimePricing(Slot s) {
		LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
		long diff = Duration.between(s.getOccupiedSince(), now).toHours();
		return (float) (Math.round((FIXED_ENTRY_PRICE + diff  * PRICE_PER_HOUR) * 100.0) / 100.0);
	}
```
- For dynamic behavior :
```java
import fr.walidg.park.parking.ParkingLotBuilder;
import fr.walidg.park.parking.ParkingLotManager;
import fr.walidg.park.parking.ParkingStructure.entity.Slot;

public class Test {
	public Test() {
	
	}
	public Float freepricing_price(Slot s) {
	//Here dynamic code
		return 0f;
		
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Test t = new Test();
		ParkingLotManager plm = new ParkingLotBuilder()
									.withPrincing(t::freepricing_price)
									.build();
	}
}

```
